0x14-bit_manipulation

we can use them to optimize code performing efficient data storage  and implimenting algorithms that involve bitwise operations the can be used to extract specific bits set or clear bits and more .Bit manipulations can be particularly useful in scenarios where memory or performance optimization is crucial such as in embedded systems or cryptography.
